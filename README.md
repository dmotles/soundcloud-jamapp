# CloudVisual - a SoundCloud streaming player with a visual component

I've made like 10 different iterations of this project but I finally want to work on one and "finish" it with all of the basic features I want:

- start/stop music
- search-as-you-type for soundcloud tracks
- some sort of visualizer using FFT frequency domain data

AngularJS is being used as the application framework.
